## Divide and Conquer
- Divide and Conquer is a way of thinking about and breaking down a problem to make it easier to develop a solution
- **2 Steps for Divide and Conquer**:
    1. Figure out the base case -> should be the simplest possible case
    2. Divide or decrease the original problem until it becomes the base case
- This is a good way to figure out how to solve a recursive problem
- See examples on pages 52 and 56 of *Grokking Algorithms*
