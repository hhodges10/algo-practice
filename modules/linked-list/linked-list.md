## Linked List

*Performance Details:*
- *Reading:* O(n)
- *Insertion:* O(1)
- *Deletion:* O(1)

*Linked List vs. Arrays:*
- `Arrays` are good for use when you need to *access data randomly* or when you have to do a lot of data accessing in general
- `Linked Lists` are good for using when you need to do a lot of *insertions* or *deletions*, or for when you need to *access data sequentially*
    - `Arrays` have to be insert new element and rewrite the rest of the elements when inserting, and same with deletion
    - `Linked Lists` just need to update the links to point to the correct element
